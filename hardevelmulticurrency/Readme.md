Thank you for purchasing!

It's very easy to use this module. You must just install it, and new tab will be appeared in catalog backoffice menu.
Filter your products and save their prices in different currencies and module will recount them to prices in your main currency.
When you will change any currency exchange rate (or it will be changed by cronjob) all product prices will be recounted with this new exchange rate.
